  T has always been my passion. I have been working in various branches of IT for over 15 years. 
  My career includes a significant tenure with the government and a parallel role at LG before I started my own business.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unfortunately, the war devastated everything—our lives, community, and dreams. Those five years were the hardest of my life. 
  I struggled to keep my family safe, moving from place to place, often without enough money for basic needs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deciding to come to Germany was not easy, especially since I had to cross the border illegally. It was a harrowing journey that lasted a month,
 but I made it and arrived in Germany in December 2015. I learned the language and began working in April 2017. I also managed to bring my family 
 (my wife and two children) to join me. <br>
 <br>

Since then, I have improved my skills by learning another programming language, QA management, and process design. Currently, 
I am learning HTML and JavaScript. <br>
<br>
Now, everything is much better, and I am proud of what I have achieved so far. I have a good job and a wonderful family.
However, one thing is still missing—my homeland. <br>
<br>
I am not sharing this story to seek compassion. I only want to tell you that no matter how bad things are around you, 
there is hope somewhere, and you just have to find it. <br>
<br>
<h3>Stay optimistic.</h3>
