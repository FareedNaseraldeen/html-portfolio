    <p>I was a member of the QA team where we planned and wrote our test 
        cases. Then, I became a QA Lead, where I created automated testing
        scenarios and code for automated tests. This role is also known as 
        QA Automation Engineer.
        As a QA Lead, I determined the test strategy and managed the entire
        QA team. Other titles for this role include Test Lead or Lead QA 
        Analyst. We utilized Katalon Studio, which is based on 
        Selenium and Java. <br>
        
        <br>
        I am truly proud of what we have achieved with the QA team.</p>
